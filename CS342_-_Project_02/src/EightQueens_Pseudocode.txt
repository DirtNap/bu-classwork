Eight Queens Algorithm:
* Place an initial queen at an arbitrary position on the board
* * Move to the next file:
* * * If this is the file of the initial queen, stop
* * * Otherwise
* * * * Generate a list of valid moves for this file given the current board placement
* * * * Iterate over the list
* * * * * Place the queen at the iterated position
* * * * * Move to the next file and try to solve
* * * * * If it fails, remove the queen and iterate to the next position
* * * Return true if 8 queens are in position, and print the board.
