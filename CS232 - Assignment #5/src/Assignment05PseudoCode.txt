This program runs according to the semantics described for Assignment 3, and includes the changes made in Assignment 4.
The difference is that the Shopper class in use is subclassed as ALShopper, a subclass of SortingShopper.  ALShopper is
functionally identical to Shopper from Assignment 3, except that it creates does the sorting discussed in Assignment 4,
and creates an ArrayList to be the backing storage for the Shopper.  The SortProvider for this throws a custom exception,
ArrayListItemMismatchException, if the array passed through the SortProvider interface is different from the contents of the
ArrayList which backs the ShoppingList.  Display of the shopping list contents and purchased items is done through the
interface ShoppingListDisplay, which is implemented by ConsoleShoppingListDisplay.
